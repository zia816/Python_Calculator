# Python_Calculator
 This Python Tkinter-based Calculator project offers basic arithmetic operations and supports complex mathematical expressions. Users can input numbers and perform calculations conveniently through a user-friendly interface. Error handling ensures smooth operation, with clear messages for invalid inputs. 
The "Calculator" project is a Python-based application built using the Tkinter library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUI) and a parser for mathematical expressions. This project aims to provide users with a versatile and user-friendly calculator tool capable of performing basic arithmetic operations as well as handling more complex mathematical expressions.

Key Features:

Graphical User Interface (GUI):
The calculator offers a sleek and intuitive GUI designed using Tkinter, allowing users to interact with the application seamlessly. The interface provides a familiar layout with buttons for digits, arithmetic operators, and special functions.

Basic Arithmetic Operations:
Users can perform fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division directly through the GUI. These operations are executed accurately and efficiently, providing reliable results.

Handling Complex Expressions:
The calculator supports the parsing of complex mathematical expressions, including parentheses, exponentiation, square roots, trigonometric functions, logarithms, and more. Users can input elaborate mathematical formulas, and the calculator will accurately evaluate and display the results.

Error Handling:
Robust error handling mechanisms are implemented to ensure smooth operation even when encountering invalid
